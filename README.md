# A Dobby PhotoJob
My program containing solutions to all the projects/labs from the course Computer Graphics 1.

## Main topics covered:


### Lab 1 : Functional and Convolutional Filters
#### Home part:
+ Functional Filters:
  + Inversion
  + Brightness Correction
  + Contrast Enhancement
  + Gamma Correction

+ Convolution Filters:
  + Blur
  + Gaussian Smoothening
  + Sharpen
  + Mean Removal Sharpen
  + Edge Detect (Left to Right)
  + Emboss (East)

#### Lab part:
+ Median Filter

#### Scores:
+ Overall: 20/20
  + Home: 15/15
  + Lab: 5/5



### Lab 2 : Dithering and Quantization
#### Home part:
+ Average Dithering
+ Octree Color Quantization

#### Lab part:
+ Average Dithering using YcBcR

#### Scores:
+ Overall: 20/20
  + Home: 15/15
  + Lab: 5/5



### Lab 3 : 2D Graphics - Drawing
#### Home part:
+ Line drawing: Symmetric Midpoint Line algorithm
+ Circle drawing: Midpoint Circle (v.2, additions only) algorithm
+ Drawing Thickness: Pixel Copy algorithm
+ Anti-Aliasing: Goupta-Sproull algorithm

#### Lab part:
+ Anti-Alisaing: 2x Super Sampling (then drawing and then downsampling for Anti-Aliasing).

#### Scores:
+ Overall: 18/20
  + Home: 13/15 (Lost points because of missing some non-algorithmic functionality i.e. only being able to move vertices one-by-one, not whole shapes.)
  + Lab: 5/5
 


### Lab 4 : 2D Graphics - Clipping and Filling
#### Home part:
+ Clipping Polygons: Sutherland-Hodgman
+ Filling Polygons:  Vertex Sorting

#### Lab part:
+ Flood filling: Boundry Fill

#### Scores:
+ Overall: 20/20
  + Home: 15/15
  + Lab: 5/5



### Lab 5 : 3D Graphics
(CPU Intensive and uses Affine transformations for the transformations).
#### Lab part:
+ Implement a rotating 3D cube made of only edges from a distance (POV on Z-axis).

#### Home part:
+ Textured Sphere: Textured 3D Sphere which can be moved around (and also POV can be moved around). We create a Triangular Mesh on/for the sphere and then fill with the texture.

#### Scores:
+ Overall: 20/20
  + Home: 15/15
  + Lab: 5/5
